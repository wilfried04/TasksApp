DEPRECATION WARNING: Single arity template handlers are deprecated. Template handlers must
now accept two parameters, the view object and the source for the view object.
Change:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template)
To:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template, source)
 (called from <main> at /home/wilromeo/Bureau/TasksApp/config/environment.rb:5)
An enum element in Task uses the prefix 'not_'. This will cause a conflict with auto generated negative scopes.
Creating scope :not_started. Overwriting existing method Task.not_started.
