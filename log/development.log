DEPRECATION WARNING: Single arity template handlers are deprecated. Template handlers must
now accept two parameters, the view object and the source for the view object.
Change:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template)
To:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template, source)
 (called from <main> at /home/wilromeo/Bureau/TasksApp/config/environment.rb:5)
An enum element in Task uses the prefix 'not_'. This will cause a conflict with auto generated negative scopes.
Creating scope :not_started. Overwriting existing method Task.not_started.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Single arity template handlers are deprecated. Template handlers must
now accept two parameters, the view object and the source for the view object.

An enum element in Task uses the prefix 'not_'. This will cause a conflict with auto generated negative scopes.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Single arity template handlers are deprecated. Template handlers must
now accept two parameters, the view object and the source for the view object.
Change:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template)
To:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template, source)
 (called from <main> at /home/wilromeo/Bureau/TasksApp/config/environment.rb:5)
An enum element in Task uses the prefix 'not_'. This will cause a conflict with auto generated negative scopes.
Creating scope :not_started. Overwriting existing method Task.not_started.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Single arity template handlers are deprecated. Template handlers must
now accept two parameters, the view object and the source for the view object.
Change:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template)
To:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template, source)

An enum element in Task uses the prefix 'not_'. This will cause a conflict with auto generated negative scopes.
Creating scope :not_started. Overwriting existing method Task.not_started.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Single arity template handlers are deprecated. Template handlers must
now accept two parameters, the view object and the source for the view object.
Change:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template)
To:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template, source)

An enum element in Task uses the prefix 'not_'. This will cause a conflict with auto generated negative scopes.
Creating scope :not_started. Overwriting existing method Task.not_started.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Single arity template handlers are deprecated. Template handlers must
now accept two parameters, the view object and the source for the view object.
Change:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template)
To:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template, source)

An enum element in Task uses the prefix 'not_'. This will cause a conflict with auto generated negative scopes.
Creating scope :not_started. Overwriting existing method Task.not_started.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Single arity template handlers are deprecated. Template handlers must
now accept two parameters, the view object and the source for the view object.
Change:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template)
To:
  >> Coffee::Rails::TemplateHandler.call(template, source)

An enum element in Task uses the prefix 'not_'. This will cause a conflict with auto generated negative scopes.
Creating scope :not_started. Overwriting existing method Task.not_started.
